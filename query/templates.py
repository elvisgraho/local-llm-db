Your task is to generate the **best possible search query** to retrieve relevant documents for answering the 'Current Query', considering the 'Conversation History' (if provided).

Strict Instructions:
1. Analyze the 'Current Query' and the 'Conversation History' (if provided).
2. Identify the core information need and key concepts in the 'Current Query'.
3. Consider the context from the 'Conversation History' to understand nuances or implicit requirements.
4. Generate a refined search query that is concise, specific, and uses keywords likely to appear in relevant documents. Think about synonyms, related terms, or potential answer structures that might guide the search.
5. **DO NOT** attempt to answer the 'Current Query'. Your sole purpose is to create the best possible search terms to *find* relevant information, not to provide the information itself.
6. Output *only* the refined search query text. No explanations, no greetings, no extra formatting.
